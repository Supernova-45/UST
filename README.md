# Uniform Spanning Trees

Notes:
- This is incomplete because the uniform spanning forest doesn't span the entire grid (missing boundary vertices)
- Code can be cleaned up a lot
- Read up on Wilson's algorithm to implement loop erased random walk (LERW) (a uniform spanning tree generation simulation)
